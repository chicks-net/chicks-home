chm-tshirt - Decode the Computer History Museum binary t-shirt message

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	chm-tshirt

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A fun little decoder for the Computer History Museum t-shirt that displays
binary numbers. The shirt shows three 8-bit binary numbers, and this script
reveals what message they encode.

This script demonstrates binary-to-decimal-to-ASCII conversion, showing each
step of the translation process. It's both a practical example of binary
encoding and a tribute to a cool piece of nerd fashion.

The original t-shirt image can be seen at:

=head1 ARGUMENTS

None. The script has the binary values hardcoded from the t-shirt design.

=head1 OUTPUT

For each binary number on the shirt, the script displays:

=over 4

=item *

The 8-bit binary representation

=item *

The decimal (base-10) equivalent

=item *

The ASCII character that decimal value represents

=back

Output format: C<binary decimal letter>

=head1 EXAMPLE

	$ chm-tshirt
	01000011 67 C
	01001000 72 H
	01001101 77 M

The binary spells out "CHM" - the Computer History Museum's initials!

=head1 HOW IT WORKS

The script uses Perl's C<pack> and C<unpack> functions to convert binary
strings to decimal values:

=over 4

=item 1.

Takes an 8-bit binary string (like "01000011")

=item 2.

Pads it to 32 bits (Perl's network byte order format requirement)

=item 3.

Packs it as a binary string (B32 format)

=item 4.

Unpacks it as a 32-bit network-order integer (N format)

=item 5.

Converts the decimal to its ASCII character with C<chr()>

=back

=head1 EDUCATIONAL VALUE

This script is a great teaching tool for understanding:

=over 4

=item *

Binary number representation

=item *

ASCII character encoding

=item *

Perl's pack/unpack functions for binary data manipulation

=item *

How text is represented in computers at the bit level

=back

=head1 NOTES

The Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California, is one of the world's
leading institutions exploring the history of computing and its impact on
society. If you haven't been, it's worth a visit - they've got everything from
the Babbage Engine to vintage gaming consoles.

This t-shirt is the kind of thing you see at tech conferences or on engineers
who appreciate a good binary joke.
