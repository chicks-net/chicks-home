=head1 NAME

fifths - Split a number into five equal portions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	fifths NUMBER

	# Examples:
	fifths 100
	fifths 42.5
	fifths 1000

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<fifths> takes a number and calculates what 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5, and 5/5 of
that number are. It's handy when you need to quickly divide something into
five equal parts - whether you're splitting a bill, dividing up work, or
just doing quick math.

The script prints out each calculation showing the formula and result, so
you can see exactly what portion of the total each fifth represents.

=head1 OPTIONS

This script doesn't take any options, just a single number argument.

=head1 EXAMPLES

Split 100 into fifths:

	$ fifths 100
	100*(1/5)=20
	100*(2/5)=40
	100*(3/5)=60
	100*(4/5)=80
	100*(5/5)=100

Works with decimals too:

	$ fifths 42.5
	42.5*(1/5)=8.5
	42.5*(2/5)=17
	42.5*(3/5)=25.5
	42.5*(4/5)=34
	42.5*(5/5)=42.5
