# .just directory

Just recipe files live in this directory.

The master copy of these project files lives in the
[FINI template-repo](https://github.com/fini-net/template-repo)
and you should be able to copy them into your
project for updates.

We use the
[repos-summary script](https://github.com/chicks-net/chicks-home/blob/main/bin/repos-summary)
to see which of our repos need updates of the just files.

You can read our
[release notes](https://github.com/fini-net/template-repo/blob/main/.just/RELEASE_NOTES.md)
to learn more about the history of how we have evolved the github PR process.
